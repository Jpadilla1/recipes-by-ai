**Yield:** Approximately 18-24 cookies

Chewy and sweet, these paleo almond cookies are completely addicting but deceptively healthy! Vegan, gluten-free, and paleo.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups store-bought almond meal
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 1 1/2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon water (if needed)

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven:** Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a bowl, combine dry ingredients (almond meal, baking soda, salt). Mix well.
3. **Mix wet ingredients:** In another bowl, combine wet ingredients (maple syrup, coconut oil, vanilla). Mix well.
4. **Combine:** Fold wet ingredients into the dry and mix. The dough should be very sticky and difficult to stir. However, if the cookie dough is impossible to stir, add a maximum of 1 tablespoon of water.
5. **Prepare baking sheet:** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (this keeps the cookies from sticking!)
6. **Shape cookies:** To make cookies, shape dough into little balls, about 1 inch in diameter. Using your hands, press down into flat disks.
7. **Arrange on sheet:** Place cookies down on baking sheet with enough space so they're not touching.
8. **Bake:** Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes (be careful – they can burn easily!!)
9. **Cool completely:** Let cookies rest on the baking sheet out of the oven until they are cooled COMPLETELY. It will be tempting, but they keep cooking for a little while they're on the baking sheet, so don't skip this step!

### Notes

- For this recipe, use store-bought 100% dry almond meal. DO NOT use almond meal from making almond milk unless it is 100% dry and moisture-free. If you use homemade almond meal that is not completely dry, the excess water content prevents the cookies from holding together.
- The final result should be a chewy, slightly undercooked cookie. Because there are no ingredients like eggs or butter, you don't have to worry about the centers spoiling!
