A simple, rustic whole wheat bread baked in a Dutch oven that requires no kneading and minimal effort.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat flour
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons fine salt
- ¾ teaspoon active dry yeast
- 2 cups room-temperature water

## Instructions

1. **Mix the dough (night before):** In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, salt, and yeast. Pour in the water and stir with a wooden spoon or spatula until everything is moistened and you have a shaggy, sticky dough. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and leave it at room temperature for 12–18 hours.
2. **Preheat the oven and pot:** When you're ready to bake, set your oven to 475°F (245°C). Place a covered Dutch oven (or other heavy oven-safe pot with lid) inside while the oven preheats so the pot gets very hot.
3. **Shape the dough:** Generously flour your hands and sprinkle flour over the surface of the risen dough. Gently loosen the dough from the sides of the bowl, adding a bit more flour as needed, and roughly form it into a ball. Either drop the dough ball directly into the hot pot, or set it on a piece of parchment and lower the parchment and dough together into the pot. Use oven mitts; the pot will be extremely hot.
4. **Bake:** Cover the pot with its lid and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and continue baking 10–15 minutes more, until the loaf is deep golden and crusty.
5. **Cool:** Lift the bread out of the pot and transfer to a wire rack. Let it cool completely before slicing.
