# Spiced Decadent Hot Chocolate

**Servings**: 2
**Prep Time**: 5 minutes
**Cook Time**: 10 minutes

## Ingredients

- **2 cups** whole milk (or your preferred milk)
- **1/2 cup** heavy cream
- **1/3 cup** high-quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa), finely chopped (Valrhona highly recommended)
- **2 tbsp** unsweetened cocoa powder
- **3 tbsp** granulated sugar (or maple syrup)
- **1/4 tsp** ground cinnamon
- **1/8 tsp** ground clove (a small pinch)
- **1/2 tsp** pure vanilla extract
- **1/8 tsp** salt
- **Whipped cream** or **marshmallows**, for topping  
- *Optional garnishes*: dark chocolate shavings, cinnamon, or chocolate syrup

## Instructions

1. **Heat the Milk and Cream**  
   In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and heavy cream. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until warm but not boiling.

2. **Add Spices and Cocoa**  
   Whisk in the cocoa powder, sugar, ground cinnamon, ground clove, and salt. Stir well until fully dissolved.

3. **Melt the Chocolate**  
   Add the chopped dark chocolate to the saucepan. Stir continuously until the chocolate is fully melted and the mixture is smooth and glossy.

4. **Simmer for Flavor**  
   Reduce the heat to low and let the hot chocolate simmer for 2-3 minutes, whisking occasionally to blend the flavors.

5. **Add Vanilla**  
   Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.

6. **Serve**  
   Pour the hot chocolate into two mugs. Top with whipped cream or marshmallows, and add optional garnishes like chocolate shavings or a light dusting of cinnamon.

## Pro Tips:
- Add 1-2 extra tablespoons of chocolate for a richer texture / thicker consistency.
- Use a strainer to sift the hot chocolate before serving to remove any lumps or undissolved cocoa powder.
