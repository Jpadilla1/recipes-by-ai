## Ingredients

### Oatmeal Base

- 1 cup rolled oats
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil
- 1 ½ cups coconut milk (canned or carton)
- ½ cup water
- ¼ cup unsweetened shredded coconut
- 1 ½–2 tablespoons coconut sugar (to taste)
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- Zest of ¼ lime

- ½ tablespoon coconut oil
- 1 teaspoon coconut sugar

### Garnish

- 2 tablespoons toasted coconut chips or flakes
- 2 tablespoons toasted cashews, roughly chopped

## Instructions

1. **Toast the base:** In a medium saucepan, heat coconut oil. Add oats and shredded coconut. Toast 2–3 minutes until fragrant and lightly golden.
2. **Simmer:** Stir in coconut milk, water, salt, lime zest, and vanilla. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 7–10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until creamy.
3. **Sweeten:** Stir in coconut sugar to taste. Add a splash more coconut milk if too thick.
4. **Make caramelized bananas:** In a skillet, melt coconut oil over medium heat. Add banana slices and sprinkle with coconut sugar. Cook ~1–2 minutes per side until golden.
5. **Toast cashews (if not already toasted):** In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast cashews for 4–5 minutes, stirring often, until golden. Chop roughly.
6. **Serve:** Spoon oatmeal into bowls. Top with caramelized bananas, toasted coconut chips, toasted cashews, and a drizzle of coconut milk.
