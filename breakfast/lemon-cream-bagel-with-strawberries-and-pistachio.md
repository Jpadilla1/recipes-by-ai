**Prep Time:** 10 mins
**Total Time:** 10 mins
**Yield:** 1-2 servings

A soft, floral, and gently sweet open-faced bagel to make your morning feel like a 5-star brunch.

## Ingredients

### Base

- 1 high-quality plain or sesame bagel (or 1 thick slice of Levain bread, lightly toasted)
- A touch of extra virgin olive oil (for brushing, optional)

### Whipped Cream

- 4 oz plain cream cheese (room temperature)
- Zest of ¼ lemon
- ½ teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
- ¼ teaspoon vanilla extract (for a hint of floral sweetness)
- Pinch of flaky sea salt

### Toppings (choose 2-3)

- Thinly sliced strawberries (or pitted cherries)
- Crushed pistachios (unsalted)
- Cucumber ribbons (optional, for a fresh savory touch)
- Maple syrup (light drizzle)
- Edible flowers or microgreens (if you want a restaurant look)

## Instructions

1. **Whip the cream cheese base:** In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese, lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, vanilla extract, and sea salt. Beat with a fork or whisk until fluffy and airy. Chill if making ahead.
2. **Toast the bagel or bread (optional):** Lightly toast for warmth and texture. Brush with olive oil if desired.
3. **Assemble:** Generously spread whipped cream cheese on each half (or on toast). Layer sliced strawberries or cucumber ribbons. Sprinkle crushed pistachios over the top. Drizzle with a touch of maple syrup. Finish with microgreens or edible flowers for plating.
4. **Serve:** Plate on a ceramic dish, serve with a warm chamomile vanilla steamer (or butterfly pea tea version), and add a flower or birthday card beside it.
