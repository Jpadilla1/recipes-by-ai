- Serves: 2
- Prep Time: 15 minutes
- Cook Time: 10 minutes

## Ingredients

- 2 slices of sourdough bread
- 1 ripe avocado
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 large eggs (for frying)
- 1/4 cup microgreens (I used rainbow microgreens)
- 1 tsp everything bagel seasoning
- Cilantro leaves for garnish
- Chopped chives for garnish
- 1 tbsp truffle oil (optional)
- Chili flakes or a dash of hot honey (optional)

## Instructions

### Prepare the Avocado Spread

In a bowl, mash the avocado with a fork until smooth but slightly chunky.
Add lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil, truffle oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well and set aside.

**Pro tips:**

1. Taste the avocado spread and adjust the seasoning as needed
2. Leave in the fridge overnight to let the flavors meld together. Highly recommend.

### Toast the Bread

Lightly toast the sourdough slices until golden brown and crisp.

**Pro tip:** Toast the bread in a skillet with a little butter for extra flavor.

### Fry the Eggs

Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Crack the eggs into the skillet and cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.

**Note:** Original recipe calls for poached eggs, but I prefer fried eggs for a crispy texture.

### Assemble the Avocado Toast

1. Spread the avocado mixture generously on each slice of toasted bread
2. Top each with a fried egg
3. Sprinkle everything bagel seasoning
4. Add microgreens, cilantro, and chives
5. Add chili flakes or hot honey if desired
