# Thin & Crispy Pancakes: Gluten-Free Perfection

**Prep Time:** 10 mins
**Cook Time:** 20 mins
**Total Time:** 30 mins
**Yield:** 8 pancakes

Delicate, thin and crispy gluten-free pancakes made with a touch of vanilla bean and creme fraiche for an incredibly creamy, custard-like texture.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup 2% milk
- 1 egg
- 1 tablespoon butter, melted
- 1 cup Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Pancake Mix
- 1/2 vanilla bean, seeds scraped
- 2 tablespoons creme fraiche

## Instructions

1. Preheat skillet to medium-high heat.
2. In a bowl, whisk together milk, egg, and melted butter. Add pancake mix and whisk until smooth.
3. For each pancake, pour 1/4 cup batter onto hot skillet. Cook until the top is bubbly, about 3 minutes. Adjust the temperature as needed.
4. Flip and cook 2 minutes more.
5. Serve immediately or hold in a warm (200°F) oven until ready to serve.

### Notes

- The creme fraiche addition is incredible - it makes the pancakes creamy, tender, and more custard-like.
