# Avocado Toast

**Prep Time:** 15 mins
**Cook Time:** 10 mins
**Total Time:** 25 mins
**Yield:** 2 servings

An elevated avocado toast with creamy avocado spread, a perfectly fried egg, and luxurious toppings like microgreens and everything bagel seasoning. The balance of creamy, tangy, and savory flavors makes it a gourmet brunch delight.

## Ingredients

- 2 slices of sourdough bread
- 1 ripe avocado
- Juice of ½ lemon
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 large eggs (for frying)
- ¼ cup microgreens (I used rainbow microgreens)
- 1 teaspoon everything bagel seasoning
- Cilantro leaves for garnish
- Chopped chives for garnish
- 1 tablespoon truffle oil (optional)
- Chili flakes or a dash of hot honey (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the avocado spread:** In a bowl, mash the avocado with a fork until smooth but slightly chunky. Add lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil, truffle oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well and set aside.
2. **Toast the bread:** Lightly toast the sourdough slices until golden brown and crisp. Optional: Toast the bread in a skillet with a little butter for extra flavor.
3. **Fry the eggs:** Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Crack the eggs into the skillet and cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.
4. **Assemble:** Spread the avocado mixture generously on each slice of toasted bread. Top each with a fried egg. Sprinkle everything bagel seasoning. Add microgreens, cilantro, and chives. Add chili flakes or hot honey if desired.

### Notes

- Taste the avocado spread and adjust the seasoning as needed.
- For best flavor, leave the avocado spread in the fridge overnight to let the flavors meld together.
- Original recipe calls for poached eggs, but fried eggs work well for a crispy texture.
