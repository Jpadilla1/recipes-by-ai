# Oatmeal Pancakes

**Prep Time:** 10 mins
**Cook Time:** 15 mins
**Total Time:** 25 mins
**Yield:** 6 pancakes

Hearty, golden oatmeal pancakes made with blended oats, coconut milk, and crème fraîche. The baking soda reacts with the crème fraîche for a beautiful rise, while the oats give a wholesome, nutty flavor.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup old-fashioned oats (blended into powder)
- 2 eggs
- ⅓ cup coconut milk
- 2-3 tbsp crème fraîche
- 1 tbsp maple syrup
- ½ tsp baking soda
- Pinch of salt
- 1 tbsp melted coconut oil

## Instructions

1. **Blend the oats:** Blend the old-fashioned oats into a fine powder using a blender or food processor.
2. **Mix wet ingredients:** Beat the eggs well, then whisk in the coconut milk, crème fraîche, maple syrup, and melted coconut oil until smooth.
3. **Combine:** Stir in the oat powder, baking soda, and salt. Rest for 5 minutes. The batter should be thick but pourable, like yogurt.
4. **Adjust consistency:** If the batter is too watery, add more blended oats a tablespoon at a time or another spoonful of crème fraîche.
5. **Cook:** Cook on medium-low heat for 2-3 minutes per side until golden.

### Notes

- Keep the heat on the lower side — baking soda and oats both brown faster than with baking powder.
- The crème fraîche has enough acidity to activate the baking soda. Use 3 tbsp if you want a better rise, since more acid means the baking soda has more to work with.
