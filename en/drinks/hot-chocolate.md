A rich and decadent hot chocolate spiced with cinnamon and clove, made with premium dark chocolate for an indulgent treat.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole milk (or your preferred milk)
- ½ cup heavy cream
- ⅓ cup high-quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa), finely chopped (Valrhona highly recommended)
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 3 tablespoons granulated sugar (or maple syrup)
- ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon ground clove (a small pinch)
- ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- Whipped cream or marshmallows, for topping
- Optional: dark chocolate shavings, cinnamon, or chocolate syrup

## Instructions

1. **Heat the milk and cream:** In a medium saucepan, combine the milk and heavy cream. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until warm but not boiling.
2. **Add spices and cocoa:** Whisk in the cocoa powder, sugar, ground cinnamon, ground clove, and salt. Stir well until fully dissolved.
3. **Melt the chocolate:** Add the chopped dark chocolate to the saucepan. Stir continuously until the chocolate is fully melted and the mixture is smooth and glossy.
4. **Simmer for flavor:** Reduce the heat to low and let the hot chocolate simmer for 2-3 minutes, whisking occasionally to blend the flavors.
5. **Add vanilla:** Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.
6. **Serve:** Pour the hot chocolate into two mugs. Top with whipped cream or marshmallows, and add optional garnishes like chocolate shavings or a light dusting of cinnamon.

### Pro Tips

- Add 1-2 extra tablespoons of chocolate for a richer texture and thicker consistency.
- Use a strainer to sift the hot chocolate before serving to remove any lumps or undissolved cocoa powder.
