# Quick Asian-Style Cucumber Salad

**Prep Time:** 5 mins
**Marinating Time:** 15-30 mins
**Total Time:** 20-35 mins
**Yield:** 4 servings

This is the refreshing, slightly sweet and tangy cucumber side you get at Chinese and Japanese restaurants - incredibly easy and actually tastes better after sitting for 30 minutes.

## Ingredients

- 7 cocktail cucumbers (or about 1 pound)
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon monk fruit sweetener (or regular sugar)
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil (optional - can skip)
- 1 clove garlic, minced (optional but recommended)
- Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Prep cucumbers:** Slice cocktail cucumbers into rounds about ⅛ inch thick. No need to peel or remove seeds.
2. **Make dressing:** In a bowl or jar, whisk together rice vinegar, soy sauce, sweetener, and sesame oil (if using) until sweetener dissolves. Add garlic if using.
3. **Combine:** Toss cucumber slices with dressing. Let sit at room temperature for 15-30 minutes, stirring or shaking once or twice.
4. **Serve:** Drain excess liquid if desired. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes if you want a little heat.

### Notes

- The cocktail cucumbers stay extra crunchy even after marinating overnight in the fridge - perfect for meal prep.
- A jar works great for making and storing these.
- **Simple variation:** Add a handful of thinly sliced red onion or sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds before serving.
