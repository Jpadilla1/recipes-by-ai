A quick and flavorful lentil dish with bright lemon and aromatic garlic. Perfect as a healthy side dish or light main course.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup green or brown lentils, rinsed
- 3 cups vegetable or chicken broth (low sodium works great)
- 2 tablespoons garlic olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon (about 3 tablespoons)
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Combine ingredients:** Add lentils, broth, cumin, and garlic olive oil to a pot. Stir to combine.
2. **Bring to boil:** Bring to a boil over high heat.
3. **Reduce heat:** Once boiling, reduce heat to low and cover the pot.
4. **Simmer:** Simmer for 20-25 minutes until lentils are tender but not mushy.
5. **Drain excess liquid:** If there's excess liquid at the bottom, drain it off by tipping the pot over the sink with the lid slightly cracked.

7. **Season:** Add salt and pepper to taste. Start with 1/2 teaspoon salt and adjust from there.
8. **Serve:** Serve warm.

### Notes

- Green or brown lentils work best for this recipe as they hold their shape well.
- The garlic olive oil adds extra flavor, but regular olive oil with minced garlic can be substituted.
- These lentils pair well with roasted vegetables, grilled chicken, or fish.
