# Bison Crunchwraps

**Prep time:** 15 min | **Cook time:** 20 min | **Yield:** 8 servings

High-protein meal prep crunchwraps with seasoned bison, melted mozzarella, and fresh toppings. Perfect for batch cooking.

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs ground bison
- 1 packet Siete Mild Taco Seasoning
- ⅓ cup water
- 1-2 heirloom tomatoes, diced
- ⅓ head romaine lettuce, shredded
- ¾ cup sour cream
- 1½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 8 large low-carb tortillas (La Banderita)
- 8 small low-carb tortillas

## Instructions

1. **Cook the meat:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Brown the ground bison, breaking it up as it cooks. Drain fat if needed.

2. **Season:** Add ⅓ cup water and the Siete taco seasoning packet. Stir and simmer 2-3 minutes until thickened. Taste and add salt if needed.

3. **Prep toppings:** Dice the heirloom tomatoes. Shred the romaine lettuce.

4. **Assemble each wrap:**
   - Lay a large tortilla flat
   - Layer in center: seasoned bison → sour cream → mozzarella → tomato → lettuce
   - Place a small tortilla on top (this creates the crunch layer)
   - Fold edges of large tortilla up and over, pleating around to seal

5. **Cook:** Heat a dry skillet over medium heat. Place wrap seam-side down and cook 2-3 minutes per side until golden and crispy.

6. Let rest 1 minute before cutting in half.

## Notes

- Scales easily: use 1 Siete packet per 1 lb of meat
- Can substitute 96% lean ground beef for bison
- Store assembled (uncooked) wraps in fridge up to 3 days; cook fresh for best crunch
- Original recipe used 4-cheese blend and light sour cream for lower macros
