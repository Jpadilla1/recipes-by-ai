# Italian Lamb Pasta with Mirepoix

**Prep Time:** 5 mins
**Cook Time:** 25 mins
**Total Time:** 30 mins
**Yield:** 4 servings

A savory Italian pasta dish featuring seasoned ground lamb simmered in a roasted garlic and basil sauce, built on a flavorful mirepoix base.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb 80/20 ground lamb
- 1 container fresh mirepoix (about 1½–2 cups)
- 1 jar (24 oz) Dave's Gourmet Roasted Garlic & Sweet Basil Pasta Sauce
- 1½ tsp Italian seasoning
- ½ tsp dried oregano
- ½ tsp salt
- ¼ tsp white pepper
- 2 tbsp garlic olive oil
- 12 oz fresh pasta
- Parmesan for serving

## Instructions

1. **Cook mirepoix:** Heat garlic olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mirepoix and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. **Brown lamb:** Push mirepoix to the sides, increase heat to medium-high. Add ground lamb and break it up. Cook until browned, about 5-6 minutes. Drain some excess fat.
3. **Season:** Stir in Italian seasoning, oregano, salt, and white pepper. Cook 1 minute.
4. **Simmer:** Pour in pasta sauce, stir everything together, reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer uncovered 12-15 minutes.
5. **Cook pasta:** Meanwhile, boil fresh pasta in lightly salted water. Drain, reserving ½ cup pasta water.
6. **Finish:** Add a splash of pasta water to the sauce and stir. Toss pasta with sauce. Serve with Parmesan.

### Notes

- Fresh pasta cooks fast—start it when the sauce has about 3-4 minutes left.
- Mirepoix is a classic French aromatic base of diced onion, celery, and carrot.
- You can substitute ground beef for the lamb if preferred.
