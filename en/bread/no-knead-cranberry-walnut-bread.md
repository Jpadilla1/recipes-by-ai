A rustic no-knead bread studded with cranberries and walnuts, with a hint of orange zest. Perfect for the holidays or everyday enjoyment.

## Equipment

- 5–6 quart Dutch oven with lid (oven-safe to 450°F / 230°C)
- Parchment paper

## Ingredients

- ½ teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1½ cups warm water (110–115°F)
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons Kosher salt
- 3 cups plus 2 tablespoons bread flour, plus more for dusting
- ¾ cup dried cranberries
- ½ cup walnuts, roughly chopped
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1 tablespoon orange zest

## Instructions

1. **Activate the yeast:** In a bowl or measuring cup, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water (110–115°F). Let sit for about 10 minutes, until foamy. If it does not foam, discard and start over (yeast is inactive).
2. **Mix the dough (no kneading) and first rise:** In a large bowl, whisk together the bread flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and honey. Stir just until no dry flour pockets remain (do not over-mix). Fold in the dried cranberries, chopped walnuts, and orange zest until just combined. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap (not touching the dough) and let sit at room temperature for 16–18 hours, ideally about 18 hours. The dough will become very wet, sticky, and bubbly.
3. **Shape the dough:** After the long rise, the dough will be very sticky and wet (this is normal). Lightly flour a work surface. Using a bench scraper, gently transfer the dough onto the floured surface and turn to coat with flour, adding more flour as needed. With floured hands, gently fold the edges of the dough toward the center to form a ball, trying not to deflate the air bubbles. Place the dough seam-side down on a piece of parchment paper, smooth side up. Reshape gently if needed and lightly flour the top. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.
4. **Preheat oven and Dutch oven:** While the dough is resting, place the Dutch oven with its lid inside your oven. Preheat to 450°F (230°C) for about 30 minutes so the pot is very hot.
5. **Score and bake:** After the 30-minute rest, score an "X" or any pattern on top of the dough. Carefully remove the hot Dutch oven from the oven. Lift the parchment paper and lower the dough (with the parchment) into the hot pot. Cover with the lid and bake at 450°F for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and bake an additional 8–10 minutes, or until the bread is deep golden brown and crusty.
6. **Cool completely:** Carefully lift the bread out of the pot and place on a wire rack. Let cool completely before slicing so the interior can finish setting and remain light and airy.
