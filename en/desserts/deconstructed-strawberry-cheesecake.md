# Deconstructed Strawberry Cheesecake

**Prep Time:** 15 mins
**Chill Time:** 2 hours
**Total Time:** 2 hours 15 mins
**Yield:** 4 servings

A lighter, healthier take on classic cheesecake using Greek yogurt and cream cheese. This no-bake dessert is layered with crushed low-carb crackers and fresh strawberries for a deconstructed presentation that's both simple and satisfying.

## Ingredients

### Cheesecake Base

- 3 cups thick plain Greek yogurt (Fage 0%)
- 8 tbsp whipped cream cheese (Whole Foods 365)
- Zest of a small lemon and juice of half the lemon
- 2 splashes vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup Swerve Organic Confectioners (monk fruit with erythritol)

### Toppings

- 1/2 cup fresh strawberries, sliced thin
- 1 serving crushed lowcarb cinnamon crackers or graham crackers (Real Phat Foods lowcarb Sweet Cinnamon crackers)
- Optional: toasted coconut flakes

## Instructions

1. **Make the cheesecake mixture:** Mix or process together the yogurt, whipped cream cheese, vanilla extract, lemon zest & juice, and Swerve sweetener until smooth and creamy. You can do this directly in the dish, or use a food processor then spread it out. Processing it is much better and recommended!
2. **Prep the toppings:** Thinly slice strawberries and set aside. Crush your lowcarb crackers or cookies. You can use however much you like, and even layer it on if you want. 1 serving was enough for the original recipe.
3. **Assemble:** Use a small rectangular dish (about the size of a meal-prep container). Spoon in the "cheesecake" mixture, then the crushed crackers, and finally strawberries. You can also layer these if you prefer.
4. **Chill:** Pop in the fridge for at least 2 hours to set. This is on the softer side because it uses yogurt and cream cheese. Then cut into 4 servings and enjoy!
