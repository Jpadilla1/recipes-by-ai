# Healthy "Snickers" Stuffed Dates (PB, Pecans, Dark Chocolate, Sea Salt)

**Prep Time:** 15 mins
**Chilling Time:** 35-50 mins
**Total Time:** 50-65 mins
**Yield:** 10-12 bites

A healthier take on the classic Snickers bar, featuring Medjool dates stuffed with salted peanut butter, pecans, and coated in dark chocolate.

## Ingredients

- 10–12 Medjool dates, pitted
- 3–4 tablespoons natural peanut butter
- 2–3 tablespoons chopped pecans
- 80–100 g dark chocolate (70%+), chopped or chips
- 1–2 teaspoons neutral or coconut oil (optional, for smoother melting)
- ¼–½ teaspoon fine sea salt (for the filling)
- Flaky sea salt for sprinkling on top

## Instructions

1. **Prep the dates:** Slice each date on one side and remove the pit. Open gently like a little pocket.
2. **Season the filling:** In a small bowl, mix the peanut butter with ¼–½ teaspoon fine sea salt (adjust to taste).
3. **Fill:** Add ~½–1 teaspoon salted peanut butter into each date. Sprinkle chopped pecans over the peanut butter and press lightly so they stick.
4. **Chill:** Place stuffed dates on a parchment-lined tray and refrigerate or freeze for 15–20 minutes.
5. **Melt chocolate:** Melt dark chocolate (and optional oil) until smooth.
6. **Coat:** Dip each stuffed date in chocolate with a fork, letting excess drip off. Place back on parchment.
7. **Finish with sea salt:** While the chocolate is still wet, sprinkle a tiny pinch of flaky sea salt on top of each.
8. **Set & store:** Refrigerate until the chocolate hardens (20–30 minutes). Store in an airtight container in the fridge up to 1 week.
