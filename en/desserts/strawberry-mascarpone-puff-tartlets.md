# Strawberry Mascarpone Puff Tartlets (a.k.a. "Puff Piece")

**Prep Time:** 20 mins
**Cook Time:** 18 mins
**Total Time:** 45 mins
**Yield:** 8-10 tartlets

A refined take on strawberries and cream, layered over crisp, golden pastry. Fresh, glossy, and balanced with just enough flair to feel restaurant-worthy — but still very doable at home.

## Ingredients

### Puff Base

- 1 sheet all-butter puff pastry, thawed but chilled
- 1 egg yolk + 1 teaspoon heavy cream (for egg wash)
- 1 tablespoon demerara sugar (for crispy edge)

### Whipped Mascarpone Cream

- 75g mascarpone cheese
- 25g heavy cream (or substitute: 15g whole milk, mix gently and don't overwhip)
- 1 teaspoon maple syrup or honey
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- Pinch of fine sea salt

### Strawberry Jam Glaze

- 100g homemade strawberry jam
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice or balsamic vinegar (to balance sweetness)
- Optional: re-strain for ultra-smooth finish

### Garnishes

- Fresh strawberry slices
- Micro basil, mint, or edible flowers
- Crushed unsalted toasted pistachios
- Optional: powdered sugar or gold dust

## Instructions

1. **Prep puff pastry:** Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment. Cut pastry into 8–10 rectangles or circles (2.5–3 inches). Score a ¼-inch border around each piece (don't cut all the way through). Dock the center with a fork (prevents puffing in the middle).
2. **Egg wash + sugar:** Mix egg yolk + 1 teaspoon cream. Brush just the borders with egg wash. Sprinkle borders with demerara sugar for texture.
3. **Bake:** Bake for 15–18 minutes, rotating once. They're done when the borders are puffed and deeply golden. Let cool completely on a rack.
4. **Make whipped mascarpone:** In a chilled bowl, whisk together mascarpone, cream (or milk), lemon zest, maple syrup, and salt until smooth and creamy. Chill while assembling the jam.
5. **Jam glaze:** Warm your strawberry jam gently in a small pot. Stir in lemon juice or balsamic to brighten flavor. Optional: strain again for a glossy, smooth finish.
6. **Assemble tartlets:** Pipe or spoon a dollop of whipped mascarpone in the center of each tart base. Top with a spoonful of jam glaze. Finish with a thin slice of fresh strawberry, basil leaf, and a pinch of pistachio dust.

### Optional Finishing Touches

- Dust lightly with powdered sugar
- Add a dot of strawberry gel, balsamic pearls, or gold leaf for Michelin flair

### Storage & Transport

- Assemble shortly before serving for best crispness
- Store unassembled components separately:
  - Baked pastry: airtight container at room temp (1 day)
  - Cream & jam: refrigerate (2–3 days)
  - Fully assembled: refrigerate, consume within 24 hours
