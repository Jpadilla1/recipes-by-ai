## Ingredients

### Puff Pastry Shells

- 1 sheet of all-butter puff pastry, cold but thawed
- 1 egg
- 1 tablespoon water (for egg wash)
- Optional: granulated sugar or cinnamon sugar for topping

### Pumpkin Cream Filling

- ¾ cup canned pumpkin purée
- ½ cup full-fat ricotta (strained 15–30 min)
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup
- 1½ tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
- Pinch of nutmeg
- Small pinch of cloves (optional)
- ⅛ teaspoon salt

### Optional Toppings

- Whipped cream
- Crushed candied pecans or walnuts
- Cinnamon sugar or powdered sugar
- Decorative pastry cut-outs (like leaves or pumpkins)

## Instructions

### Puff Pastry Shells

1. **Preheat oven:** Set to 375°F (190°C, conventional). Line a baking sheet with parchment.
2. **Cut pastry:** On a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry slightly. Cut into 2.5–3 inch squares or rounds.
3. **Score & dock:** Lightly score a smaller square inside each cut piece, about ¼" from the edge. Use a fork to dock the inner square.
4. **Egg wash:** Beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water. Brush the outer border only.
5. **Bake:** Bake for 20–24 minutes, or until deeply golden and puffed.
6. **Shape shells:** While warm, press down the center with a spoon to form a well. Let cool completely.

### Pumpkin Cream Filling

1. **Strain ricotta:** Place in a fine-mesh strainer or cheesecloth over a bowl for at least 15 minutes to reduce graininess.
2. **Whip:** In a bowl, combine pumpkin, strained ricotta, maple syrup, brown sugar, cream, vanilla, spices, and salt. Use a hand mixer or whisk until smooth and fluffy.
3. **Chill (optional):** For easier piping, chill the filling for 15–30 minutes.

### Assembly

1. Once the puff pastry shells are cooled, spoon or pipe the pumpkin cream into each well.
2. Top with any of the optional toppings: a small dollop of whipped cream, crushed candied pecans or walnuts, a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar or powdered sugar, or decorative pastry cut-outs (like leaves or pumpkins).

### Make-Ahead Tips

- Pastry shells can be baked a day ahead. Store uncovered at room temp to keep crisp.
- Pumpkin cream can be made and chilled up to 2 days ahead.
- Fill the shells just before serving (or up to 2 hours prior) to preserve crispness.
