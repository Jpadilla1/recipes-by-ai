# 4 Ingredient Coconut Almond Cookies

**Prep Time:** 10 mins
**Cook Time:** 14 mins
**Total Time:** 24 mins
**Yield:** 18 cookies

These coconut almond cookies are so easy to whip up -- you only need four ingredients and they're so delicious. No one will guess they're vegan and gluten-free.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups unsweetened flake coconut
- ½ cup dark chocolate chips (mini or regular)
- 3 tablespoons chopped salted almonds
- ½ cup sweetened condensed coconut milk

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven:** Preheat the oven to 325°F.
2. **Prepare baking sheet:** Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
3. **Prepare coconut milk:** Check to see if your sweetened condensed coconut milk is in a liquid state. If it is, you can skip this step. If not, pour sweetened condensed coconut milk into a small saucepan and heat over super low heat until mixture is liquid. Don't heat too long because you don't want the coconut milk to get too hot. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes.
4. **Mix ingredients:** In a medium mixing bowl combine coconut flakes, chocolate chips, chopped almonds and liquid sweetened condensed coconut milk. Stir until everything is well coated with the coconut milk. The dough will be pretty sticky/wet and that's okay.
5. **Scoop dough:** Use a medium-large cookie scoop to scoop out dough and place onto your prepared baking sheet with parchment paper.
6. **Flatten cookies:** Using the back of a spoon or your fingers (moistened with a little water), press each cookie down a bit to flatten.
7. **Bake:** Bake cookies for 12 to 14 minutes or until the coconut flakes are just starting to turn golden brown.
8. **Cool and store:** Let cool completely on baking sheet before serving. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for longer storage. Cookies will last at least 7 days in the fridge.

### Notes

- Make sure you look for flaked coconut that is in longer strands, not coconut flakes that look more like chips.
- Step 3 is optional if your condensed coconut milk is already liquid and easy to pour, but canned sweetened condensed coconut milk tends to harden and separate when stored in a cool place.
- You can use mini or regular sized chocolate chips. For vegan cookies, be sure to use dairy-free chocolate chips.
